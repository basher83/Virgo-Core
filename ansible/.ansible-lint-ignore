# Ansible-lint ignore file
# Format: filename/path rule-id [optional comment]
# Lines starting with # are comments
# This file allows ignoring specific rules for specific files

# Example:
# playbooks/legacy-playbook.yml var-naming  # Legacy playbook, to be refactored

# Templates are linted separately and often have complex Jinja2
# ansible/templates/*.j2 yaml

# Ignore load-failure for templates with heavy Jinja2 logic
# ansible/roles/*/templates/*.j2 load-failure

# Add file-specific exceptions below as needed
# Use sparingly - prefer fixing issues over ignoring them
