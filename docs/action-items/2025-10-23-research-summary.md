## Pattern Insights

### Universal Patterns (All 7 roles - 100% adoption)

**Testing & Quality:**
- Molecule + Docker testing infrastructure (even for minimal 3-task roles)
- GitHub Actions CI with separate lint and molecule jobs
- Idempotence testing as primary quality verification
- Multi-distribution testing (3-7 platforms depending on complexity)

**Variable Management:**
- Role-prefixed variable naming preventing conflicts (e.g., `system_user_*`)
- defaults/ for user configuration, vars/ for OS-specific values
- List-of-dicts pattern for flexible variable structures
- Inline documentation for complex variables

**Documentation:**
- README structure: Title → Requirements → Variables → Example → License
- Variable tables showing defaults and descriptions
- Example playbook usage
- Comprehensive galaxy_info in meta/main.yml

**Structure:**
- Feature-based task file splitting (when > 5-7 tasks)
- Handler naming matches service names
- Template organization in templates/ directory
- Consistent directory presence (even if empty in minimal roles)

### Contextual Patterns (Scale appropriately - 23 patterns)

**Testing Distribution Coverage:**
- Simple roles: 3 distributions (ubuntu, debian, rockylinux)
- Complex roles: 6-7 distributions (add archlinux, fedora, amazonlinux)

**Task File Organization:**
- Minimal roles: 1 task file (3-5 tasks total)
- Low complexity: 1-2 task files (5-10 tasks)
- Medium complexity: 3-5 task files (10-20 tasks)
- High complexity: 8+ task files (20+ tasks)

**Variable Count:**
- Utility roles: 3-5 variables
- Service roles: 10-15 variables
- Configuration management: 20+ variables

**Handler Presence:**
- Service roles (docker, nginx, postgresql): Have handlers
- Utility roles (pip, git, users): No handlers needed
- Appropriate based on role purpose

**Platform Support:**
- Utility roles: Broader platform support (GenericLinux, GenericUNIX)
- Complex roles: Focused platform support (specific versions)

### Evolving Patterns (Improvements in newer roles - 14 patterns)

**Advanced Techniques:**
- `include_vars` with `first_found` lookup (better OS fallback than simple conditionals)
- Jinja2 block inheritance in templates (user extensibility without forking)
- Conditional handler execution with boolean flags
- `meta: flush_handlers` for mid-play handler execution

**Variable Documentation:**
- Complex variable inline documentation (postgresql best practice)
- Showing all dict keys with required/optional/default markers
- Example values alongside variable definitions

**Testing Strategies:**
- MOLECULE_PLAYBOOK variable for testing different installation methods
- Multi-scenario testing (default + feature-specific scenarios)
- Check mode support with `ignore_errors: "{{ ansible_check_mode }}"`

**Configuration Management:**
- Template path variables for customization (nginx pattern)
- Both reload AND restart handlers for flexibility
- Validation handler patterns (alternative to task-level validation)

## Virgo-Core Role Assessment

### Overall Pattern Compliance

| Role | Structure | Variables | Documentation | Handlers | Meta | Testing | Overall |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|------|---------|---------|
| system_user | 90% | 85% | 95% | 100% | 95% | 0% | 77% |
| proxmox_access | 90% | 95% | 80% | 100% | 70% | 0% | 72% |
| proxmox_network | 98% | 100% | 95% | 100% | 100% | 0% | 82% |

**Average Compliance:** 77% (Good foundation, one critical gap)

### Strengths Across All Roles

- **Excellent task organization** - Feature-based splitting, clear naming, logical flow
- **Strong variable naming** - Role-prefixed, descriptive, follows conventions
- **Comprehensive README documentation** - Exceeds many geerlingguy roles in troubleshooting
- **Appropriate handler usage** - Service roles have handlers, utility roles don't
- **Security-conscious design** - Validation steps, permission checks, warnings

### Universal Critical Gap

**No testing infrastructure** across all three roles:
- Missing molecule/ directory
- No CI/CD workflows
- No automated idempotence verification
- No distribution testing matrix

This is the **only universal pattern (7/7 roles)** that all Virgo-Core roles are missing.

### Role-Specific Strengths

**system_user:**
- Outstanding troubleshooting section (better than most geerlingguy roles)
- Security considerations prominently documented
- Idempotency explicitly explained
- Clear separation of user creation vs SSH key management

**proxmox_access:**
- Excellent task modularization (8 feature files vs typical 1-3)
- Comprehensive security warnings for token management
- Complex ACL permission handling well-documented
- Multi-stage role structure (roles → groups → users → tokens → ACLs)

**proxmox_network:**
- Built-in verification tasks (pattern rarely seen)
- Advanced handler patterns (reload with stabilization)
- Network stabilization handling (sleep after network changes)
- Declarative configuration approach

## Success Metrics

- ✅ **7 production roles analyzed** (2M+ to 100K+ downloads each)
- ✅ **6 pattern documents created** (5,784 total lines of guidance)
- ✅ **1 reference index created** (233 lines, 7 roles indexed)
- ✅ **3 roles compared** (system_user, proxmox_access, proxmox_network)
- ✅ **32 action items generated** with effort estimates and file paths
- ✅ **Pattern confidence levels documented** (47 universal, 23 contextual, 14 evolving)
- ✅ **Overall compliance assessed** (77% average, excellent foundation)

2. **Implement molecule testing** - System_user as pilot (2 hours)
   - Create molecule/default/molecule.yml
   - Create molecule/default/converge.yml
   - Test with 3 distributions (ubuntu2404, ubuntu2204, debian12)

3. **Add GitHub Actions CI** - System_user as pilot (2 hours)
   - Create .github/workflows/system_user-ci.yml
   - Separate lint and test jobs
   - Test matrix for distributions

### Short-Term (Next 1 month)

1. **Roll out testing to all roles** (12-16 hours total)
   - proxmox_access molecule + CI setup
   - proxmox_network molecule + CI setup
   - Validate idempotence across all roles

2. **Address important items** (8-12 hours)
   - Complete galaxy_info for all roles
   - Enhance README variable tables
   - Add troubleshooting sections where missing

3. **Document testing patterns** in Virgo-Core
   - Testing strategy for Proxmox-specific roles
   - Distribution matrix decisions
   - CI/CD integration patterns

### Long-Term (Next 3 months)

1. **Implement nice-to-have items** selectively (8-10 hours)
   - CI/CD badges in READMEs
   - Advanced testing scenarios for complex roles
   - Template enhancement patterns where valuable

2. **Extend pattern research** for Phase 4+
   - Analyze kubernetes + mysql for orchestration patterns
   - Consider Debops for variable organization at scale
   - Investigate HA patterns from OpenStack-Ansible

3. **Publish roles to Galaxy** (after testing infrastructure complete)
   - System_user as basher83.system_user

   - Proxmox_network as basher83.proxmox_network

## Conclusion

The Ansible role validation research successfully analyzed 7 production geerlingguy roles (8M+ combined downloads) and extracted 84 distinct patterns across 6 comprehensive documents totaling 5,784 lines of guidance. Pattern confidence is high with 47 universal patterns confirmed across 100% of roles.

The research validates that Virgo-Core's Phase 1-3 roles (system_user, proxmox_access, proxmox_network) demonstrate **excellent fundamentals** with 77% average compliance against production patterns. The roles excel in structure (90-98%), variable management (85-100%), documentation (80-95%), handlers (100%), and meta (70-100%).

The **single critical gap** across all three roles is the absence of testing infrastructure (molecule + CI/CD), which is a universal pattern in 7/7 analyzed roles. This gap is addressable with focused effort (18-24 hours for all three roles) and will establish the foundation for confident Phase 4+ development.

The enhanced ansible-best-practices skill now provides production-validated guidance for all future role development, ensuring Virgo-Core roles meet or exceed community standards. The 32 prioritized action items provide a clear roadmap for continuous improvement with realistic effort estimates.

**Research Status: Complete and Actionable**
